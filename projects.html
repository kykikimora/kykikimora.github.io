            <p>This is a repo full of buttons that do exciting things when you press them. I don't know how to make buttons, so the functionality of this repo is still developing. In this project, I experiment and play and keep it silly.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/kykikimora/PushTheseButtons">Push These Buttons</a></h2>
            <p>This is a slightly more professional presenting project. I'm trying to understand my own development flow through the exciting world of buttons. The buttons here will be examples to reference for potential work. Therefore, they attempt to be a touch more presentable than my other button repo.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/kykikimora/webdev-task-001">Webdev-task-001</a></h2>
            <p>This is a forked repo from Code:You. Should I put this here? Is that a good and professional thing to do? Is that what I'm supposed to do? All exciting questions that will get answered at the next class! Untill then, see how I delight in html and css, learning how to build a vocabulary list webpage.</p>
