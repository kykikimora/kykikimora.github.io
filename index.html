                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m a design-minded developer focused on building clear, accessible web experiences through thoughtful problem-solving, communication, and iteration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I approach development with a communicator’s mindset—prioritizing clarity, good questions, and shared understanding. My experience in community-work and cross-functional environments has strengthened my ability to collaborate, gather requirements, and build solutions with real users in mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently developing core web skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) through small projects and continuous iteration.
