                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Design-minded developer focused on building clear, accessible web experiences through thoughtful problem-solving, communication, and iteration. I approach development with a communicator’s mindset—prioritizing clarity, good questions, and shared understanding. My experience in community-work and cross-functional environments has strengthened my ability to collaborate, gather requirements, and build solutions with real users in mind. Currently developing core web skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) through small projects and continuous iteration.</p>
